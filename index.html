	</div>
	<div class="content">
			<p>Forget marathons, there is nothing harder than ultrarunning and these 10 athletes are some of the best in the world in the discipline of long distance.</p>
			<p>Being an ultrarunner takes hard work, passion, and natural talent. These races are longer than a marathon, generally run on trails, and typically range in length from 50 (80 km) to 100 miles (160 km). Famous events include the Western States 100, the Hardrock 100, and the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc.</p>
			<p>How does a runner go from being in the peloton to getting on the podium frequently? “There comes a point where doing kilometers and kilometers is not going to be enough to really progress. You need to train smart, rest well and above all have a passion for hitting the slopes, ”says British ultrarunner Damian Hall.</p>
			<p>As in any elite sport, there is a circuit specialized in ultrarunning and the best athletes usually coincide in the most important events. Despite the fact that these athletes are very competitive, the atmosphere is often one of friendly rivalry</p>
			<p>“I don't think I've ever met a trail ultrarunner that I didn't like. Camaraderie is more important than competition. People help you when you have problems ”.</p>
			<p>There is no definitive list but here are 10 of the best, of which six will participate this year in the now classic Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc.</p>
